    "text": "1 🚀 Introduction to Shiny\nShiny is an R package that allows you to turn your R scripts into interactive web applications without needing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge.\n\n\n\n2 🧱 Key Components of a Shiny App\nA basic Shiny app has two key parts:\n\n\n\nComponent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nui (User Interface)\nControls the layout and inputs/outputs\n\n\nserver\nContains the logic to handle input/output and computation\n\n\n\n\n2.0.1 ✏️ Basic Example\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Lucky number\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      sliderInput(\"num\", \"Choose a number:\", 1, 100, 25)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      textOutput(\"result\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$result &lt;- renderText({ paste(\"You selected:\", input$num) })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\n\n⸻\n\n\n2.0.2 💡 Why Use Shiny?\n\nGreat for interactive dashboards\nPowerful for data exploration and simulation\nEnables non-programmers to interact with data\n\n⸻\n\n\n2.0.3 📦 Deployment Options\n\nLocal: Run directly in RStudio\nShiny Server: Host internally\nshinyapps.io: Cloud-hosted deployment\n\n⸻\n\n\n2.0.4 🧠 Summary\nShiny is an excellent tool for building reactive, user-friendly applications that make your R analysis come alive."
