## 🌐 What is Shinylive?

**Shinylive** allows you to run Shiny apps **entirely in the browser**, powered by **WebAssembly**. No R server or shinyapps.io is required.

## ⚙️ How Shinylive Works

-   Your R code is compiled to WebAssembly
-   The entire app runs **client-side** in the browser
-   It's deployed as a **static HTML file**
